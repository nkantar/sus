sus: Static URL Shortener
=========================

**sus** is a static site based URL shortener.
Simple idea: generate a static site with a bunch of
``redirect-slug-goes-here/index.html`` files with nothing but an HTML redirect in them.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: sh

    # note: you’ll need Python 3.9 or higher
    pip install sus


Usage
-----

#. Install package
#. Have an ``input`` file ready
#. Have a ``home.html`` file ready (optional)
#. Run ``sus`` in the same directory as ``input``
#. Voilà—your results are in the ``output/`` directory


Input
-----

sus expects to find a file named ``input`` in the current directory, and each row
consists of the redirect slug and destination URL, separated by a pipe (``|``).
Lines starting with the hash ``#`` are considered comments and thus ignored,
and blank lines are ignored as well.

E.g.,

.. code-block::

    nk | https://nkantar.com
    sus | https://github.com/nkantar/sus

    # this is a comment and will be ignored
    # the blank line above will also be ignored

If one were to serve ``output/`` on `<https://sus-example.nkantar.com>`_, then
`<https://sus-example.nkantar.com/nk>`_ would redirect to `<https://nkantar.com>`_ and
`<https://sus-example.nkantar.com/sus>`_ would redirect to
`<https://github.com/nkantar/sus>`_.

That example site exists, and its repository can be found at
`<https://github.com/nkantar/sus-example.nkantar.com>`_.


Homepage
--------

If sus finds a ``home.html`` file next to ``input``, it will copy it to
``output/index.html``, thereby generating a homepage.
If it doesn’t, it will simply carry on.


Pronunciation
-------------

Much controversy has sparked around the pronunciation of the project’s name (no, it
hasn’t).
As such, here is the definitive guide on doing so, as conceived by the original author.
Please note that—much like with
`GIF <https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/battle-over-gif-pronunciation-erupts/>`_
—others may have different ideas, and who’s to say the author knows what he’s talking
about anyway?

“sus” is in this case pronounced as in “suspicious”, and
`Wiktionary <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sus#English>`_ helpfully provides the
following guide:

- `IPA <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:International_Phonetic_Alphabet>`_ (`key <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:English_pronunciation>`_): /sʌs/
- Rhymes: `-ʌs <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Rhymes:English/%CA%8Cs>`_
- `Homophone <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Glossary#homophone>`_: `suss <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suss#English>`_


Development
-----------

The project by default uses `Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`_, and ``make install``
should get you up and running with all the dev dependencies.
After that see other ``make`` commands for convenience.
They correspond to CI checks required for changes to be merged in.

The ``main`` branch is the bleeding edge version.
`Git tags <https://github.com/nkantar/sus/tags>`_ correspond to releases.


Contributing Guidelines
-----------------------

Contributions of all sorts are welcome, be they bug reports, patches, or even just
feedback.
Creating a `new issue <https://github.com/nkantar/sus/issues/new>`_ or
`pull request <https://github.com/nkantar/sus/compare>`_ is probably the best way to get
started.
